# Cat Clicker, v1

This is the first version of the "Cat Clicker" application, created before working through the [Design Patterns course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud989-nd).

It is included for comparison with [version 2](https://github.com/Tempurturtul/udacity-fend-projects/tree/master/fend-design-patterns/cat-clicker-v2), which was created after working through the course.
