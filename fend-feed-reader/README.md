# Feed Reader

This is the **6th and final** project in Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program.

**[View here.](http://tempurturtul.github.io/fend-feed-reader/)**

In this project I'm given an application with the beginnings of a test suite using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/). My task is to finish the spec file for the application and ensure all tests pass.

Tests are located in  `jasmine/spec/feedreader.js`.


## Quickstart

- Clone this repository.
```
  git clone https://github.com/Tempurturtul/fend-feed-reader.git
```
- Navigate to the project directory and open the `index.html` file in your browser of choice.
