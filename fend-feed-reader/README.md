# Feed Reader

This is the **6th and final** project in Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program.

**[View here.](https://tempurturtul.github.io/udacity-fend-projects/projects/fend-feed-reader/dist/)**

In this project I'm given an application with the beginnings of a test suite using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/). My task is to finish the spec file for the application and ensure all tests pass.

Tests are located in  `jasmine/spec/feedreader.js`.

- Clone the repository and navigate to this project.
```
  git clone https://github.com/Tempurturtul/udacity-fend-projects.git
  cd udacity-fend-projects/fend-feed-reader/
```
- Open the `index.html` file in your browser of choice.
