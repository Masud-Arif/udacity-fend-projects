# Portfolio
This is the **1st** project in Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program.

**[View here.](https://tempurturtul.github.io/udacity-fend-projects/projects/fend-resume/dist/)**

In this project, I am provided with a design mockup for a portfolio website that I must replicate.  The website I create must be responsive, and must provide an overview of each of the portfolio projects that I complete throughout the nanodegree program.  It must also adhere to the program's [styleguide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/) and be validated against the [W3C's Validators](http://validator.w3.org/).  I am free to personalize the design as I wish.
