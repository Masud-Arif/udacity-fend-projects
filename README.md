# Udacity FEND Projects

The directories in this repository prefixed `fend` contain my completed projects from Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program.

Each `fend` project was added using [git-subtree](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/subtree/git-subtree.txt) from what were originally individual repositories. For tips on navigating individual project commit histories, see this [Stack Overflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14992078).

The `projects-index/` directory is the exception, and is original to this repository. It contains the index site hosted on this repository's `gh-pages` branch.

**See project directories for project details.**
