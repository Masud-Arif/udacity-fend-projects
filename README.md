# fend-resume
This is the second project in Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program.

In this project I was required to complete Udacity's [JavaScript Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-basics--ud804) course, which covers the construction of the basic resume site using a provided template. I was then allowed to personalize the result.

I used the Polymer iron-collapse component in order to achieve the "Exceeds Specifications" evaluation.  I also used Gulp and Bower during development to aid my workflow.

## Project Notes

The live site may be viewed at [tempurturtul.github.io/fend-resume](http://tempurturtul.github.io/fend-resume).
