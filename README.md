# fend-frogger

This is the third project in Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program. It provides art assets and a game engine that must be used to build a frogger clone. I am required to implement only the basic game, but am encouraged to implement additional features of my choosing.
