# fend-optimization

This is the fourth project in Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program. It provides a portfolio website that must be optimized.

## Project Notes

Source code may be found in the `src` directory.

I heavily automate optimization with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). See `gulpfile.js` for details.
