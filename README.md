# fend-frogger

**Play here:** [tempurturtul.github.io/fend-frogger](http://tempurturtul.github.io/fend-frogger/)

**Controls:** Use the arrow keys or the WASD keys to move. If on a touch-enabled device (mobile for example) you may also use touches to move.

This is the third project in Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program. It provides art assets and a game engine that must be used to build a frogger clone. I am required to implement only the basic game, but am encouraged to implement additional features of my choosing.

Source code may be found in the `src/client` directory. The game is intended to be played at the link above, but may also be played by opening the `src/client/index.html`  file in your browser of choice.
