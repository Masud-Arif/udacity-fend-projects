# Resume
This is the **2nd** project in Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program.

**[View here.](http://tempurturtul.github.io/fend-resume)**

In this project I was required to complete Udacity's [JavaScript Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-basics--ud804) course, which covers the construction of the basic resume site using a provided template. I was then allowed to personalize the result.

I used the [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) `iron-collapse` component in order to achieve the "Exceeds Specifications" evaluation, and used Gulp and Bower during development to aid my workflow.

## Quickstart

- Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), and [Bower](http://bower.io/).
- Clone this repository and install dependencies.
```
  git clone https://github.com/Tempurturtul/fend-resume.git
  cd fend-resume/
  npm install
  bower install
```
- Run the default gulp task to serve source files. *(See `gulpfile.js` for additional tasks.)*
```
  gulp
```
