# Escape By Water! (A Frogger Clone)

This is the **3rd** project in Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program. It provides art assets and a simple game engine that must be used to build a frogger clone. I am required to implement only the basic game, but am encouraged to implement additional features of my choosing.

**[Play here.](http://tempurturtul.github.io/fend-frogger/)**

## Controls

- Use the **arrow keys** or the **WASD keys** to move.
- If on a touch-enabled device (mobile for example) you may also use **touches** to move.
