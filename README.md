Followed Udacity's [rubric](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd001/l-2696458597/m-2687128535) and [instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true) while completing the project.

## Course Notes

"You will learn JavaScriptâ€™s object oriented programming features to write eloquently designed classes capable of creating countless instances of similarly functioning objects. You will discover a variety of ways inheritance and delegation can be used to create well architected and performant applications."

1. If you need a refresher on Object Oriented JavaScript, review our course and OOJS Notes. This Office Hours video and readme is also helpful.
2. If you'd like a more detailed explanation as to how the game engine works, see our HTML5 Canvas course. Office Hours P3: Understanding Engine.js is also very helpful.
3. Read the detailed instructions for the project. (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub)
4. Download the art assets and provided game engine. (https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)
