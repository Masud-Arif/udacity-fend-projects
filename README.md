# fend-resume
This is the second project in Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program.

In this project, I am instructed to complete Udactiy's [JavaScript Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-basics--ud804) course during which I will build the resume site.
