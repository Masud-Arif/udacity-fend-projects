# fend-portfolio
This is the first project in Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program.

In this project, I am provided with a design mockup for a portfolio website that I must replicate.  The website I create must be responsive, and must provide an overview of each of the portfolio projects that I complete throughout the nanodegree program.  It must also adhere to the program's [styleguide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/) and be validated against the [W3C's Validators](http://validator.w3.org/).  I am free to personalize the design as I wish.

## Project Notes

The live site may be viewed at [tempurturtul.github.io/fend-portfolio](http://tempurturtul.github.io/fend-portfolio).
